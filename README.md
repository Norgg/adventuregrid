## A Grid With Some Adventure In
This is a small experimental online game I wrote a while back. You can move around the grid using W/A/S/D and enter some text into any empty grids you find.

It's written in django, now updated to work in django 3.

## Setup
 * Install python and pip (some kind of virtualenv recommended)
 * `pip install -r requirements.txt.lock`
 * `./manage.py runserver`
